#HINT: This study is a copy/paste of ADX with the addition of horizontal lines at 20 and 25. \n\n It also has a label that appear when ADX is less than 20, indicating the symbol is not trending or is range bound.  And a label that appears when ADX is greater than 25, indicating the symbol is now trending.


# if you always want your custom study to sppear above or below the chart you can add declare upper;  or declare lower; to your ThinkScript code
declare lower;


# input creates field in the Edit Studies box to make it easy to make changes without need to alter the ThinkScript code.
