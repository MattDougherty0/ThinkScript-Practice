#HINT: IV percentile RANK is an indicator that compares current IV to the high-low IV range over a specific number of weeks.  \n\nIV percentile denotes whether option prices are currently high/low relative to the high/low range for ImpVolatility and therefore IV percentile rank can be used as a strategy selection tool.  \n\nFor example, select negative Vega strategies when IV percentile rank is high [red label], select positive Vega strategies when IV percentile rank is low [green label], select small positive or negative Vega strategies when IV percentile rank is neutral [light gray label].  \n.

# HINT: This IV percentile is NOT a 0 - 100 rank of where current IV is located within the 52-week high/low range for ImpVolatility.  Instead this IV percentile compares 52-weeks of ImpVolatility data to determine where current IV is located relative to "normal" ImpVolatility.
# Many times IV percentile rank will be same or similar to IV percentile, however, if there has been a spike high or spike low in the ImpVolatility high/low range that spike(s) can skew IV percentile rank causing current IV to appear lower or higher than actual realtive to "normal" IV
